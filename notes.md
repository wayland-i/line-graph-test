Things that need to happen:

1. the chart needs to work with api data
    I want an api that shows me Gold, the S&P500, the DowJones, and Bitcoin

2. The chart needs to filter timelines
    The chart should allow the user to filter the time-line of data that they are seeing - i.e. 7-days, 1 month, year-to-date, All time


3. I want the graph to visually look like the windows '98 aesthetic

This may be achieved by creating 10,000 html divs and then changing the color of one grid location where the price should be at that date

or

There might be a better way with the d3.js library or other visaulization tools that I could customize to look "pixelated and win 98"
